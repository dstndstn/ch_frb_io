/**

 "Ring buffer" prototype.

 This class is meant to hold a data stream.  As a way of controlling
 the amount of memory used, it is allowed to have a maximum number of
 objects alive at any time.  When clients retrieve objects from the
 ring buffer, the objects are kept alive (via shared_ptrs), and
 continue to count toward the ring buffer's quota of live objects.
 Only when the last shared_ptr is dropped does the ring buffer get to
 add a new object.

 The use case is that we need to support callbacks (RPCs) that
 retrieve a lot of data and write it to disk, or send it over the
 network, which could take a long time.  While this is happening, we
 don't want to use more and more memory in the ring buffer; we want to
 control the total memory footprint.  We do this by assuming that the
 objects in the ring buffer are all the same size, so then we just
 need to limit the number of objects that are "live".  The RPC client
 will keep objects live via shared pointers.  When the ring buffer is
 asked to accept more data (via push()) and it is already at its
 limit, then it will begin dropping the oldest data from the buffer.
 If no client is holding a pointer to these objects, then they will be
 freed and space will become available for the new data.  If the whole
 buffer is dropped and space still does not become available, then
 space cannot be allocated for the new object and the push() fails.

 This is implemented via shared_ptr Deleter functionality: the Deleter
 is just a function that is called immediately before an object is
 about to be deleted.  The ring buffer decrements its count of the
 number of live objects when this happens; it then knows it is allowed
 to allocate one more new object.
