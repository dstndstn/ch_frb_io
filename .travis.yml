# Travis-CI.org build script

# Default travis-CI environment is Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS "precise"
# which is pretty old:
# (gcc 4.6.3, which doesn't know about -std=c++11
#  and fails with
#  ch_frb_io.hpp:279:28: sorry, unimplemented: non-static data member initializers
#  ch_frb_io.hpp:279:28: error: ISO C++ forbids in-class initialization of non-const static member 'udp_port'
# )

# "trusty" is Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
# gcc 4.8.4
# and compiles our code just fine.  Use that!
